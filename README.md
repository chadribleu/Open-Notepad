## Do you remember the good-old Windows Notepad ?
This project aims to recreate the original Windows Notepad, but with some enhancements such as tabs or recent documents list.
Open-Notepad was programmed entirely in C++, with the OOP design and the "raw" win32 API in mind to ensure consistency with Windows's native UI while make it really fast for all computers.

## Installation
Currently, no executable files are provided for an apparent reason.
However, if you want to test the app as-is, it is all good! :)

0. Install Visual Studio Community 2022 with C++ components
1. Clone the whole repository
2. Launch the ``.sln``
3. Select ``Debug x64`` for the build output
4. Build the solution
5. Go to your output directory (You can check it via ``Project | Properties | General | "Output Directory"``)
6. Launch ``Toadpad.exe``

## What can I do with the current build?
Here are the current features that are implemented within Open-Notepad:
- Basic raw text functions
- Save, create and load files (only UTF8 encoding is supported for the moment)
- Determine if the file is dirty or not
- Wrap words to window size
- Tabs
- Shortcuts
- Custom font
- Line and columns counter
- Status bar
- App icon

## What's next?
- Visual way to d√©termine if one document was saved
- Home page

# Chadribleu.Dialogs library
## What is that?
``Chadribleu.Dialogs`` is a tiny library to encapsulate dialogs such as ```FilePicker```, ```ChooseFont```, ```PickColor``` and ```CustomDialog```. The library is still using a deprecated way to create the dialogs (``OPENFILENAME`` for example). Additionally, if you're working on an app that is using ANSI functions, my library is not for you, because it's using ``wchar_t`` to store characters, but the "macro version" of all functions though.
